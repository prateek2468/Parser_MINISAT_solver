## Introduction
The MINI-SAT Solver and Parser is a compact project aimed at providing a basic SAT solver and parser for propositional logic formulas. Whether you're interested in understanding SAT solving concepts or need a foundation for implementing more advanced solvers, this project can serve as a starting point.

## Features
- Simple and minimalistic SAT solver implementation.
- Parser for converting propositional logic formulas into internal representations.
- Easily understandable codebase, suitable for educational purposes.
- "Sample Code C++" file containing various DSA code snippets.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To use the MINI-SAT Solver and Parser, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- CMake (for building the project)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```

git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-sat-solver.git
cd mini-sat-solver
```
Build the project using CMake:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
## Usage
### Running the Solver
To run the SAT solver, execute the generated executable:

```
./mini-sat-solver formula.cnf
```
Replace formula.cnf with the path to the DIMACS CNF file containing the propositional logic formula you want to solve.

### Using the Parser
The parser can be utilized by including the appropriate header files and using the provided functions. Refer to the source code and documentation for detailed information.

### Sample Code C++
The "Sample Code C++" file contains a collection of sample code snippets for various Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C++. Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt these snippets for your own projects.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to the MINI-SAT Solver and Parser project, please follow our Contribution Guidelines.
